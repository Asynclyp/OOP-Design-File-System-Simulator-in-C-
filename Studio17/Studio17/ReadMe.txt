2. The first test that we ran was to simply create an image file and then to print out the name of the file and the size of the file which was set to zero. The next test that was ran was to write a file into the program and then determine the size of the square image and print the board. This again worked as expected printing out the information of the board appropriately to the terminal. The next test case was to attempt to append the program. Nothing occured and a nonzero value was returned. This worked as expected not altering the contents of the file.

3. The benefits to programing a client to use an interface rather than a concrete class is due to the fact that it does not restrict the implementation of the class. By using an interface, we can change the concrete implementation however we want without changing the client code at all.

4. In order to add a variety of different file types, you would need to alter the createFile function such that it is able to accept those different file endings and to create those new objects.
